<h2>Emotions</h2>
<p>
Every day is a new adventure,
</p>
<p>
fighting with emotions
</p>
<p>
anger,sadness happiness,giult are some demonstrations
</p>
<p>
Ego the king of all, anger his slave
</p>
<p>
can destroy the lovely eight letter word
</p>

</p>
<p>
The best thing about feeling happy,
</p>
<p>
is that you'll think you'll never feel unhappy.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to the heroes who have moulded our life,
</p>
<p>
especially who have dangerous wives.
</p>
<p>
And the queen of love is she,
</p>
<p>
she bonds the bond of friendship between.
</p>
<p>
Mightier than then the ocean,
</p>
<p>
stronger than the wind,
</p>
<p>
here comes the fear.
</p>
<p>
He breaks the kind inside your sharp mind.
</p>
<p>
Emotions, emaotions don't mess with them,
</p>
<p>
or else they will bring to ultimate death.
</p>
<p>
Fight with them and keep them neat,
</p>
<p>
then see the result whom you'll meet!!!
