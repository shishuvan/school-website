<ul> Terminals
-	<br>By Hetali Mehta from Std IX K
<br>
<p>
The terminals are here, the terminals are here, 
<br>Bringing with them apprehension and fear.
<br>Work very hard, study day and night,
<br>It is going to be a competitive fight.
</p>
<p>Biology, Physics, Evs and Chemistry,
<br>English, Hindi, Geography and History.
<br>Writing tirelessly, page after page,
<br>Trapped amidst exams like a bird in a cage.
</p>
<p>A paper worth 80 marks, 2 hours long,
<br>Questions and answers, either right or wrong.
<br>15 days of examination, 11 papers in all,
<br>3 science practicals, oh my god, I will fall!
</p>
<p>We welcomed the end of the terminal examination,
<br>Allaying our chagrin and frustration.
<br>As our day of independence came close,
<br>Our happiness was eminent, from our heads to the toes.
</p>
<p>Now that the terminals are over, we await a blast,
<br>All papers will be shown, from the first to the last.
<br>The exams have gone well, full of fear and fun,
<br>Capturing us at first, we now celebrate under the sun.
</p>
